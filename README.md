# ðŸŒ˜ Stylus CSS Inline

* JS version for inline scoped `<script>` only.
* Unfortunately invalid CSS is automatically removed from `<link>` and `@import()` making those paths invalid.
  * Requires loading via custom JS function to work. Might or might not be worth it?
    * Could load and inline `<script>` at top?
* Can use python version for easy "build" Stylus.
